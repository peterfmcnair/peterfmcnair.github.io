# Now
Life has been moving very quickly lately, so I wanted to take a moment to catch up on what my plans are.
## Work
I have started a new gig as a Technology Translator through [TRaCE](www.trace.org.au). My team gives 'roadside assistance' to startups, SMEs and big industry players in clean energy and recycling fields.
## Travel
I spent an incredible seven weeks travelling Europe. The standout was absolutely the Vatican – it was beautiful at every turn.

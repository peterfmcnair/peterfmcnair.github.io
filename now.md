# What's up, doc?
## Brief Updates
Life has been moving very quickly lately, so I wanted to take a moment to catch up on what I'm up to:
1. Finished uni
2. Went travelling in Europe
3. Started work
4. House hunting
## Work
I have started a new gig as a Technology Translator through [TRaCE](www.trace.org.au). My team gives 'roadside assistance' to startups, SMEs and big industry players in clean energy and recycling fields.
## Travel
I spent an incredible seven weeks travelling Europe. The standout was absolutely the Vatican – it was beautiful at every turn.

## House Hunting
I'm on the lookout for a place close to uni so my commute isn't quite as hectic!

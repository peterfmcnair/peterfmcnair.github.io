# Personal Embeds
Having been writing on this blog for a while now, I'd like to find the best way to embed quick videos for reference.

I currently use google photos, but annoyingly there is no evergreen way to link to a video hosted on google photos (their photos seem to work okay if you use )

## Google Photos
Video share link created on 2023-11-25, using [this tool](https://www.publicalbum.org/blog/embedding-google-photos-image).
However this doesn't display in a jekyll website nor in a website hosted by obsidian, so I have a feeling this method won't work unfortunately. Strangely, it will display in my local obsidian files - more investigation needed.
Trying with an iframe does not work either.

## Google Drive
Next up is google drive. Since google photos and drive [removed the ability to access google photos in drive](https://blog.google/products/photos/simplifying-google-photos-and-google-drive/)

## Drop Box
I have an image I'm linking to from Dropbox:

And a dropbox video:


## Flickr

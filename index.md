# About me
A recently converted Aussie running acolyte, you'll find me at my happiest in Sydney's beautiful Centennial park.

I'm a hardware guy. In my capacity as a Technology Translator, I develop motor controllers for drone powertrains, develop power electronics to improve solar panel performance and investigate novel forms of energy storage (gravity anyone?) at the megawatt scale.
